# Robot-Evacuation Problem
A project for COMP 4001. Problem definition that is supposed to be solved:

Consider k mobile robots inside a circular disk of unit radius. The robots
are required to evacuate the disk through an unknown exit point situated on
its boundary. We assume all robots having the same (unit) maximal speed
and starting at the centre of the disk. The robots may communicate in order
to inform themselves about the presence (and its position) or the absence
of an exit. The goal is for all the robots to evacuate through the exit in
minimum time. We consider the wireless communication in which robots can
communicate with one another at any time/distance.
